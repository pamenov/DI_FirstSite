            <h2> National Team </h2>


            <p>Didier Drogba's involvement with the Ivory Coast national team was closely tied to the country's civil war. He made his international debut in 2002, during a time when the country was deeply divided and violence was rampant.</p>

            <p>Despite these challenges, Drogba and his fellow players saw the national team as a symbol of unity and hope for the country. They worked hard to bring people together and promote a message of peace and reconciliation.</p>

            <p>In 2005, during a crucial World Cup qualifying match, Drogba made a passionate plea for peace on national television. He begged both sides of the conflict to lay down their arms and come together for the good of the country. His emotional speech had a profound impact, and within days, a ceasefire was declared. </p>

            <p>Drogba continued to play a key role in the national team's efforts to promote peace and reconciliation. He helped lead the team to the 2006 World Cup, their first-ever appearance in the tournament, and again in 2010, when he scored the winning goal in the final qualifying match. </p>

            <p>Drogba's impact on his country went beyond football. He used his fame and influence to support various humanitarian efforts, including the construction of hospitals and schools.</p>

            <p>In 2011, when violence erupted again in Ivory Coast after a disputed election, Drogba once again used his voice to promote peace. He called for calm and urged his fellow citizens to come together and work towards a brighter future.</p>

            <p>Drogba's legacy in Ivory Coast extends far beyond his footballing achievements. He is widely admired for his dedication to promoting peace and reconciliation, and his efforts have inspired many others to work towards a better future for the country.</p>

            <p>Didier Drogba has been widely recognized for his peacekeeping and philanthropic work. Through his foundation, the Didier Drogba Foundation, he has been actively involved in improving the lives of people in Ivory Coast and beyond. </p>

            <p>One of the key areas of focus for the foundation is education. Drogba has been a strong advocate for education, believing that it is one of the most powerful tools for creating positive change. The foundation has built schools and provided scholarships to young people, particularly girls, who may not otherwise have had access to education.</p>

            <p>In addition to education, the foundation has also worked to improve healthcare in Ivory Coast. Drogba has been a vocal supporter of efforts to combat diseases such as malaria, and the foundation has worked to build hospitals and provide medical supplies to communities in need.</p>

            <p>Drogba's work has also extended beyond Ivory Coast. In 2007, he was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). In this role, he has worked to promote peace and stability in his home country and elsewhere in Africa.</p>

            <p>During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, Drogba used his platform to raise awareness and funds to combat the disease. He worked with the UNDP and other organizations to provide medical supplies and support to affected communities.</p>

            <p>Drogba's philanthropic work has earned him numerous accolades, including the Chevalier de la LÃ©gion d'honneur, one of France's highest honors. In 2018, he was named a World Health Organization Goodwill Ambassador, further cementing his role as a leading advocate for health and well-being.</p>

            <p>Overall, Drogba's peacekeeping and philanthropic work have had a significant impact on the lives of many people, particularly in Ivory Coast. He has used his platform and resources to create positive change and promote a brighter future for those in need.</p>
